# Personal-Site

This is going to contain the HTML5UP Hyperspace template personalized for 'goodgoodalright'. 
This will also contain the html files (and assets) that link to completed portfolio works.

- Added the 'readme-edits' branch. This will be the primary working branch if it is more feasible to handle all portfolio changes here than in their own branches (like project1-branch and its children, project2-branch and its children, etc.).
