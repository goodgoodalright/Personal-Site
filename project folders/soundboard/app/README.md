Main Idea - Create a Soundboard

What? The opening music to Learn with Leon.
What else? Have sound soundbites of 'yuhs,' 'ayy,' 'ya got got,' 'first tryyyyy,' and other tropes. This will be used to interact and use with the main music.

Style/Design/CSS: TBD

Daniel: HTML/CSS 

Kevin: Photoshop background of Leon on a stage.

Mili:

Michael:

Allison: 

Denver: Getting sound files organized into clips.


Outline: Write general ideas/structure here!

Form: Have the main music playing in a button. Have other buttons that play the mini sound clips to interact with the main music.
